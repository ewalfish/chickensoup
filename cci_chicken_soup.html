    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the Soup:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8-10 cups chicken stock (or enough to cover chicken)</li>
        <li>1 whole chicken (about 3 pounds)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 medium carrots, peeled and sliced ½ inch thick on the bias</li>
        <li>4 celery stalks, peeled and sliced ½ inch thick on the bias</li>
        <li>3 medium leeks, white part only, sliced ½ inch thick on the bias, cleaned in cold water</li>
        <li>Bouquet Garni: 1 bay leaf, a few parsley sprigs, a few thyme sprigs, tied with kitchen twine</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly pressed</li>
        <li>Fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¾ cup dried ditalini or other small macaroni-type pasta</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice (or more to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon</li>
        <li>¼ cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Croutons:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly smashed</li>
        <li>2 slices homemade-style white bread, cut into ½-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons fresh grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Soup:</strong><br>
            Place the whole chicken, breast side down, in a large, deep soup pot. Add the chicken stock and 1 tablespoon kosher salt (if the stock is unsalted). Bring to a boil, skim the surface, and then reduce heat to a simmer. Add the carrots, celery, leeks, bouquet garni, and garlic, and season with black pepper. Simmer the chicken for 15 minutes. Flip the chicken over and continue simmering for another 25 minutes or until cooked through.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong><br>
            Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Croutons:</strong><br>
            In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and sauté until golden, then remove and discard the garlic. Add the bread cubes to the garlic-flavored oil, season with salt, and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the croutons are golden on all sides. Remove from heat and toss with Parmesan cheese. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Finish the Soup:</strong><br>
            Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot and allow it to cool. Taste the vegetables; if they are not tender, continue simmering. Remove the bouquet garni and garlic from the pot. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat into medium pieces. Whisk in the butter (optional) and lemon juice into the soup, adjusting seasoning as needed. Add the chopped tarragon, parsley, cooked pasta, and shredded chicken to the soup. Stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong><br>
            Serve the soup hot, topped with Parmesan croutons.
        </li>
    </ol>
